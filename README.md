# TerraVerdeEnergyChallenge

# The Challenge:

Using python, write a function that takes a list of x, y coordinates in 2-dimensional space as an input, and that returns a distinct list of lines that intersect 3 or moreuniquepoints from the input set.This function may be part of a larger application that includes other functions, etc.

# Running the python file:

`python3 lines.py`

# Functions used:

 - `The function 'is_collinear' checks if the three given points on two dimensional space are collinear or not.
The function finds the area of a triangle and if the area is zero then the lines are collinear and returns true and vice 
versa.`

 - `The function 'line_equation' returns the equation of a line for any given two points.`

 - `The function 'line_func' takes in a list of coordinates of two dimensional space and returns a list of 
equations of lines which passes through three or more points from the given coordinates.`
